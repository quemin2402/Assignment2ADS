# Assignment 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures

This project includes custom implementations of fundamental data structures in Java: `MyStack`, `MyQueue`, and `MyMinHeap`. Each class is built using either `MyArrayList` or `MyLinkedList` as the underlying data structure.

## Data Structures Included

- **MyStack**: A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure implemented using `MyLinkedList`.
- **MyQueue**: A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure implemented using `MyLinkedList`.
- **MyMinHeap**: A complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its children, implemented using `MyArrayList`.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.
4. Run the `Main.java` class to see the data structures in action through provided examples in the `main` method.

## Usage Examples

The `Main` class includes examples of using each data structure. It demonstrates pushing and popping from a stack, enqueueing and dequeueing from a queue, and inserting and extracting from a min-heap. The examples also handle edge cases like operations on empty data structures.
